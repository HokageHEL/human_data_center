## 1. Product Overview
Implement a comprehensive archive system for the Human Data Center application that allows users to archive personnel records instead of permanently deleting them, with full archive management capabilities including viewing, filtering, exporting, restoring, and permanent deletion.

- The system will maintain data separation between active and archived personnel for future export capabilities while providing seamless archive operations through a dedicated interface accessible from settings.
- This feature addresses data retention requirements and provides administrators with better control over personnel data lifecycle management.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles
No additional user roles required - the archive system will be accessible to all existing users through the settings page.
